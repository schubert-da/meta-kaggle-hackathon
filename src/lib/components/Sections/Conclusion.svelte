		While I might seem pretty pro-Kaggle throughout this article, I do want to make one thing clear
		- <em>all</em> of these criticisms are valid. In fact, Kaggle's competitions are far from perfect
		when it comes to landing jobs and teaching you everything you need to know about machine learning
		in the real world. The last thing I want to do is paint a picture that Kaggle alone will solve all
		your problems.
	</p>

	<p>
		What it will help you do is learn. To paraphrase an analogy I once read - "practising data
		science on Kaggle is like learning to drive in a car park". You learn how to start the car,
		accelerate and brake, shift gears and get into the flow of driving. This doesn't mean that you
		know how to fend for yourself on a multilane highway or brave inclement weather but it's any day
		better than never getting into the car in the first place.
	</p>

	<p>
		So is Kaggle good for landing a data science job? Yes, but not on its own. Use it as your
		foundation, complement it with real-world projects, and you'll have a compelling story to tell
		employers.
	</p>

	<p>
		Delve into Kaggle with the sole intention of learning, <em>not winning</em>. Understand why you
		are doing things the way you are and the theory behind it rather than chasing the first shiny
		new tool that will do the work for you. And when you feel like you're getting the hang of
		things, maybe gather some real world data and work on a side project that resonates with you.
