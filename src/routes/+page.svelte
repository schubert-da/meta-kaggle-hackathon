			Kaggle is a great place to learn for newcomers and data science enthusiasts - learning
			competitions to take your first steps, integrated environments that make spinning up a model
			easier than ever, interesting problem statements to experiment on different domains and
			learning through collaboration and friendly competition.
		</p>

		<p>
			But it still gets a lot of flak because it isn't a mirror to working on actual data science
			problems in the real world. Experts contend that datasets are spoon-fed - skipping any actual
			data collection and cleaning process, competition problems are not reflective of the typical
			day-to-day work of a data scientist, sometimes the quality of the data is poor or it's hard to
			source in real projects which is never the case in Kaggle projects, timelines are unrealistic
			in comparison to real-life projects.
